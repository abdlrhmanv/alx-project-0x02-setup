# Next.js Project Setup and Basics
this repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of building modern web applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as a hands-on guide to setting up a robust development environment, structuring a scalable project, and implementing core features such as routing, component reusability, API integration, and responsive design.

Throughout this project, we will:
- Scaffold a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Implement page routing using the Pages Router
- Build reusable UI components with strong TypeScript typing
- Fetch data from external APIs (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
- Apply best practices in code organization and maintainability
